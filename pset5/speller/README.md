## According to its man page, what does `getrusage` do?

getrusage() returns resource usage measures for who, which can be one of the following:

## Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type `struct rusage`?
struct rusage
{
               struct timeval ru_utime; /* user CPU time used */
               struct timeval ru_stime; /* system CPU time used */

               long   ru_isrss;         /* integral unshared stack size */

## Why do you think we pass `before` and `after` by reference (instead of by value) to `calculate`, even though we're not changing their contents?

TODO

## Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how `main` goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function's `for` loop works.

TODO

## Why do you think we used `fgetc` to read each word's characters one at a time rather than use `fscanf` with a format string like `"%s"` to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on `fscanf` alone?

TODO

## Why do you think we declared the parameters for `check` and `load` as `const` (which means "constant")?
